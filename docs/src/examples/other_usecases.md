# Other known use cases

There are a few other use cases of our package scattered around the ecosystem. Instead of reproducing these here, we simply link to a few of them:

- [`GlobalSensitivity.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/GlobalSensitivity.jl) uses `Copulas.jl` to provide Shapley effects implementation. See their example [here](https://docs.sciml.ai/GlobalSensitivity/stable/tutorials/shapley/).
- [`EconomicScenarioGenerators.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaActuary/EconomicScenarioGenerators.jl) uses `Copulas.jl`'s dependence structures to construct multivariate financial assets. See their example [here](https://juliaactuary.github.io/EconomicScenarioGenerators.jl/stable/#Correlated-Scenarios).
- [`StochasticWeatherGenerators.jl`](https://github.com/dmetivie/StochasticWeatherGenerators.jl) uses `Copulas.jl`'s dependence structures to build the dependency between several different weather metrics. Their [whole documentation](https://dmetivie.github.io/StochasticWeatherGenerators.jl/dev/) is amazing to read !
