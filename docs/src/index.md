# Welcome to Copulas.jl!

The [Copulas.jl](https://github.com/lrnv/Copulas.jl) package provides a large collection of models for dependence structures of real random vectors, known as [copulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)), with a wide selection of features:
- random number generation
- evaluation of (log)density and distribution functions
- copula-based multivariate distributions via Sklar's theorem
- fitting procedures, including marginal models
- evaluation of dependence metrics

Since copulas are distribution functions, we fully comply with the [`Distributions.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) API. This compliance allows direct interoperability with other packages based on this API, such as [`Turing.jl`](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl).

Usually, users who work with copulas turn to the `R` package [`copula`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/copula/copula.pdf). While still well-maintained and regularly updated, the `R` package `copula` is a complicated code base in terms of readability, extensibility, reliability, and maintenance.
This package aims to provide a lightweight, fast, reliable, and maintainable copula implementation in native Julia. Among other benefits, a notable feature of such a native implementation is floating point type agnosticism, i.e., compatibility with `BigFloat`, [`DoubleFloats`](https://github.com/JuliaMath/DoubleFloats.jl), [`MultiFloats`](https://github.com/dzhang314/MultiFloats.jl), and other numeric types.


The package revolves around two main types:

- `Copula`, the abstract supertype of all copulas
- `SklarDist`, the type for multivariate compound distributions via [Sklar's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)#Sklar's_theorem)

## Getting started

The package is registered in Julia's General registry so you may simply install the package by running : 

```julia
] add Copulas
```

The API contains random number generation, cdf and pdf evaluation, and the `fit` function from `Distributions.jl`. A typical use case might look like this: 

```@example
using Copulas, Distributions, Random, Plots
X₁ = Gamma(2,3)
X₂ = Beta(1,4)
X₃ = Normal()
C = ClaytonCopula(3,5.2) # A 3-variate Clayton Copula with θ = 0.7
D = SklarDist(C,(X₁,X₂,X₃)) # The final distribution

simu = rand(D,1000) # Generate a dataset
D̂ = fit(SklarDist{ClaytonCopula,Tuple{Gamma,Normal,Normal}}, simu) # estimate a model
plot(D̂) # plot the result
```

The list of availiable copula models is *very* large, check it out on our [documentation](https://lrnv.github.io/Copulas.jl/stable) ! 
The general implementation philosophy is for the code to follow the mathematical boundaries of the implemented concepts. For example, this is the only implementation we know (in any language) that allows for **all** Archimedean copulas to be sampled: we use the Williamson transformation for non-standard generators, including user-provided black-box ones.

## Feature comparison


There are competing packages in Julia, such as [`BivariateCopulas.jl`](https://github.com/AnderGray/BivariateCopulas.jl) which only deals with a few models in bivariate settings but has very nice graphs, or [`DatagenCopulaBased.jl`](https://github.com/iitis/DatagenCopulaBased.jl), which only provides sampling and does not have exactly the same models as `Copulas.jl`. Since rencently, we cover both of these packages functionalities completely, while still bringing, as a key feature, the compliance with the broader ecosystem. The following table provides a feature comparison between the three: 

|                          | `Copulas.jl`            | `DatagenCopulaBased.jl` | `BivariateCopulas.jl` |

Since our primary target is maintainability and readability of the implementation, we did not consider the efficiency and the performance of the code yet. Proper benchmarks will come in the near future.
