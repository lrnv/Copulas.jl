# General discussion

Archimedean copulas are a large class of copulas that are defined as : ... [ details needed...]

Adding a new `ArchimedeanCopula` is very easy. The `Clayton` implementation is as short as: 

```julia
struct ClaytonCopula{d,T} <: Copulas.ArchimedeanCopula{d}
    θ::T
end
ClaytonCopula(d,θ)            = ClaytonCopula{d,typeof(θ)}(θ)     # Constructor
ϕ(C::ClaytonCopula, t)        = (1+sign(C.θ)*t)^(-1/C.θ)          # Generator
ϕ⁻¹(C::ClaytonCopula,t)       = sign(C.θ)*(t^(-C.θ)-1)            # Inverse Generator
τ(C::ClaytonCopula)           = C.θ/(C.θ+2)                       # θ -> τ
τ⁻¹(::Type{ClaytonCopula},τ)  = 2τ/(1-τ)                          # τ -> θ
williamson_dist(C::ClaytonCopula{d,T}) where {d,T} = WilliamsonFromFrailty(Distributions.Gamma(1/C.θ,1),d) # Radial distribution
```
The Archimedean API is modular: 

- To sample an archimedean, only `ϕ` is required. Indeed, the `williamson_dist` has a generic fallback that uses [WilliamsonTransforms.jl](https://www.github.com/lrnv/WilliamsonTransforms.jl) for any generator. Note however that providing the `williamson_dist` yourself if you know it will allow sampling to be an order of magnitude faster.
- To evaluate the cdf and (log-)density in any dimension, only `ϕ` and `ϕ⁻¹` are needed.
- Currently, to fit the copula `τ⁻¹` is needed as we use the inverse tau moment method. But we plan on also implementing inverse rho and MLE (density needed). 
- Note that the generator `ϕ` follows the convention `ϕ(0)=1`, while others (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)#Archimedean_copulas) use `ϕ⁻¹` as the generator.
