# Other known use cases. 

There are a few other use cases of our package that are scatter around the ecosystem. Instead of reproducing these here, we simply link to a few of them : 

- [`GlobalSensitivity.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/GlobalSensitivity.jl) exploits `Copulas.jl` to provide Shapley effects implementation, see there example [there](https://docs.sciml.ai/GlobalSensitivity/stable/tutorials/shapley/). 
- [`EconomicScenarioGenerators.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaActuary/EconomicScenarioGenerators.jl) uses `Copulas.jl`'s dependence structures to construct multivariate financial assets, see their example [there](https://juliaactuary.github.io/EconomicScenarioGenerators.jl/stable/#Correlated-Scenarios).
